# Your strategic partner for digital work.

I'm a generalist, full stack software engineer, with an emphasis on front end engineering. My mission is to build quality, robust software and help some people along the way, too.

When I'm not coding, you can find me doing all sorts of things - snowboarding, riding my motorcycle, reading a new book, cooking a new recipe, hiking, or weightlifting.

I attended Marist College and graduated with a BS in Business Administration, with a concentration in Marketing, and an IT / Psychology minor. I worked in marketing and project management for several years before quitting my job and learning how to code (thanks Flatiron School).

Throughout my professional career, I've worked at a number of different organizations, doing everything from building software, SEO, UX / UI design, and user testing to teaching students and coaching junior engineers. My assorted experience at agencies, small startups, and ed-tech companies gives me a fresh, unique perspective that shines through in my work.

# Your strategic partner for digital work.

I'm not just a web developer, but a partner who can help bring your vision to life with solid coding practices built on a foundation of critical thinking, project management, and marketing. Having worked at a several different companies, from agencies to small to startups, to larger companies in ed tech, I bring a wealth of experience from a variety of roles to my work.

I work great as a solo developer, but also excel when collaborating others, and have plenty of experience coaching junior developers and helping them grow.

I thrive in startups and in smaller organizations, but work well at larger organizations that embody these characteristics too.

# Your strategic partner for digital work.

I'm not just a software engineer, but a partner who can help bring your vision to life. I have almost a decade of combined experience successfully shipping applications and managing projects. My current focus is building full stack applications and coaching junior developers. My assorted experience at agencies, small startups, and ed-tech companies give me a unique perspective that makes me an asset at any organization.

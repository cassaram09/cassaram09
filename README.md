# Your strategic partner for digital work.

I'm not just a web developer, but a partner who can help bring your vision to life with almost a decade of experience across software development, project management, and marketing. My current focus is building full stack applications and coaching junior developers. My assorted experience at agencies, small startups, and ed-tech companies give me a unique perspective that makes me an asset at any organization.
